- Admin permissions (or follow the [non-admin installation guide](/non-admin-install))

## Installation

<Step title="Add to Slack">
  Click the **Add to Slack** button on the Clarity website. You will be redirected to Slack to authorize the app.
</Step>

  After installation, Clarity will send you a direct message. Click **Complete Setup** to open the onboarding modal where you can:
  
  - Select which channels to enable auto coaching

## Your first command

Once installed, try the rephrase command to see Clarity in action:

```
/clarity-rephrase I need this done ASAP its really urgent
```

Clarity will suggest an improved version:

> Could you please prioritize this? I need it completed as soon as possible.

Click **Replace** to update your message or **Keep original** to dismiss.
