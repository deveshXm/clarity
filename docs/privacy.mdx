Your privacy matters. Here is how Clarity handles your Slack messages and data.

## What Clarity accesses

Clarity only accesses messages in channels where you have enabled auto coaching or when you explicitly use commands like `/clarity-rephrase`.

| Data | When accessed | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Message content | When coaching is triggered | To analyze and suggest improvements |
| Channel membership | During setup | To show available channels in settings |
| User profile | During installation | To identify you in the workspace |
| Email address | During installation | For account and support purposes |

## What Clarity does NOT access

- Messages in channels where coaching is disabled
- Direct messages (unless you enable auto coaching there)
- Files, images, or attachments
- Message history before installation

## Data storage

### Message content

Messages are processed in real-time and **not stored** after analysis. Once Clarity generates a suggestion, the original message content is discarded.

### User preferences

Your settings (coaching flags, enabled channels) are stored securely and associated with your Slack user ID.

### Usage data

We track anonymized usage metrics (e.g., number of suggestions generated) to improve the service and enforce usage limits.

## Third-party services

Clarity uses the following services:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| OpenAI | AI analysis for message improvement |
| Stripe | Payment processing |
| MongoDB | User preferences storage |

<Note>
Message content sent to OpenAI is not used to train their models. See OpenAI's data usage policy for details.
</Note>

## Data deletion

To delete your data:

1. Remove Clarity from your Slack workspace
2. Email support@clarityapp.io to request full data deletion

We will delete all associated data within 30 days of your request.

## Security

- All data is encrypted in transit (TLS)
- Database access is restricted and audited
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties
