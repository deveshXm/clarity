## Settings modal

The settings modal has several sections:

### Coaching flags

Enable or disable the coaching flags that Clarity uses to analyze your messages. Check a flag to enable it, uncheck to disable.

Default flags include:

- **Professional tone** — Suggests formal alternatives to casual language
- **Clarity** — Simplifies complex or unclear sentences
- **Brevity** — Shortens unnecessarily long messages
- **Inclusive language** — Recommends more inclusive word choices

### Auto coaching channels

Select which channels should have auto coaching enabled. When enabled, Clarity will automatically analyze messages you send in those channels.

<Tip>
You can enable auto coaching for direct messages too, not just public channels.
</Tip>

### Edit flags (Pro)

Pro users can create custom coaching flags tailored to their needs. Click **Edit Flags** to:

- **Add a flag** — Create a new custom flag with a name and description
- **Edit a flag** — Modify an existing custom flag
- **Delete a flag** — Remove a flag you no longer need

<Note>
Custom flags are personal to your account. Teammates on the same workspace can create their own.
</Note>

## Admin settings

Workspace admins see additional options:

### Billing

Access the Stripe billing portal to:

- View current subscription
- Upgrade to Pro
- Update payment method
- View invoices

### Transfer admin

Transfer admin rights to another user in your workspace. Once transferred, you will lose admin access.

<Warning>
Admin transfer is permanent. The new admin will have full control over billing and workspace settings.
</Warning>

## Saving changes

Click **Save** at the bottom of the modal to apply your changes. Settings take effect immediately.
