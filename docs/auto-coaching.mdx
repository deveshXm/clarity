Auto coaching analyzes your messages in real-time and offers suggestions to improve them before or after you send.

## How it works

1. **You send a message** in a channel where auto coaching is enabled
2. **Clarity analyzes** the message against your active coaching flags
3. **If improvements are found**, you receive a private suggestion
4. **You decide** whether to replace your message or keep the original

<Note>
Only you can see the coaching suggestions. Your teammates see the original message until you choose to replace it.
</Note>

## Enabling auto coaching

Open settings to enable auto coaching for specific channels:

```
/clarity-settings
```

In the settings modal:

1. Find the **Auto coaching channels** section
2. Check the channels where you want coaching enabled
3. Click **Save**

<Tip>
Start with one or two channels to get comfortable with the feature before enabling it workspace-wide.
</Tip>

## Suggestion format

When Clarity finds an improvement, you will see:

```
"Your original message..." → "Improved version"

**Flag Name** — Brief explanation of the improvement

[Replace]  [Didn't like it]

Only you can see this
```

- **Replace** updates your original message with the improved version
- **Didn't like it** dismisses the suggestion

## Coaching flags

Auto coaching uses your active coaching flags to determine what to look for. Common flags include:

| Flag | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| Professional tone | Avoids casual language in work contexts |
| Clarity | Simplifies complex or unclear sentences |
| Brevity | Shortens unnecessarily long messages |
| Inclusive language | Suggests more inclusive alternatives |

Customize your flags in [Settings](/settings).

## Usage limits

Auto coaching suggestions count toward your monthly limit:

| Plan | Monthly limit |
|------|---------------|
| Free | 20 suggestions |
| Pro | 200 suggestions |

Check your current usage with `/clarity-status`.
