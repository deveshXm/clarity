If you are not a Slack workspace admin, you will need to request installation from someone who is.

## Why admin permission is needed

Slack requires workspace admin approval to install apps that access messages and channel data. This protects your workspace from unauthorized apps.

## How to request installation

<Steps>

<Step title="Find your workspace admin">
  In Slack, go to **Settings & administration** → **Manage members** to see who has admin privileges. Or ask in a general channel.
</Step>

<Step title="Share the install link">
  Send your admin the Clarity install link:
  
  ```
  https://clarityapp.io
  ```
  
  Explain that Clarity helps improve Slack communication with AI-powered coaching.
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for approval">
  Your admin will review the app permissions and decide whether to install it. Once installed, Clarity becomes available to everyone in the workspace.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete your personal setup">
  After installation, you can configure your own settings:
  
  1. Run `/clarity-settings`
  2. Select your coaching preferences
  3. Enable auto coaching for your preferred channels
</Step>

</Steps>

## What to tell your admin

Share these key points:

- **Purpose**: Clarity coaches users to communicate more effectively in Slack
- **Privacy**: Messages are analyzed in real-time and not stored
- **Cost**: Free tier available; Pro is $4.99/month per workspace
- **Permissions**: Requires access to messages in channels where coaching is enabled

## If your request is denied

If your admin declines to install Clarity:

- Ask about their specific concerns (security, cost, etc.)
- Share the [Privacy](/privacy) page to address data concerns
- Suggest a trial period to evaluate the app

## After installation

Once Clarity is installed, you will have full access to all features within your plan limits. The person who installed becomes the workspace admin for Clarity and can manage billing.

<Note>
Each user configures their own coaching preferences. Your settings are personal and do not affect teammates.
