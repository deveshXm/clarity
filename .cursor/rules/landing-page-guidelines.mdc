# Clarity Landing Page – Do’s and Don’ts

## Operational Guidelines (read-first)

- Do not run builds unless explicitly asked
  - Do not execute `npm run build` or any production build commands unless the user explicitly requests it.
  - Prefer local lint/type checks only when making iterative edits.

Context files to reference:
- Light layout and font: [src/app/(public)/layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/layout.tsx)
- Landing implementation: [src/app/(public)/page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/page.tsx)
- Global CSS background/overscroll fixes: [src/app/globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css)
- Background mesh component: [src/app/(public)/components/BackgroundMesh.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/components/BackgroundMesh.tsx)
- Feature scroller component: [src/app/(public)/components/FeatureScroller.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/components/FeatureScroller.tsx)
- CTA button (gradient) component: [src/app/(public)/components/CTAButton.tsx](mdc:src/app/(public)/components/CTAButton.tsx)

## Do's

- Use the light-mode route group with Manrope font
  - Background: Gradient from `rose-50` → `amber-50` → `sky-50` (`bg-gradient-to-b from-rose-50 via-amber-50 to-sky-50`)
  - Keep `min-height: 100svh` per layout.
  - Ensure `html, body` background matches gradient to avoid white overscroll.

- Vibrant, warm color palette
  - Background gradient: rose-50 → amber-50 → sky-50 for warmth and energy
  - Primary accents: Rose (#E11D48), Amber (#D97706), Emerald (#059669), Sky (#0284C7)
  - Text: Slate-900 for headings, Slate-700 for body, Slate-500 for secondary
  - Cards: White/80 with backdrop-blur for modern glass effect
  - CTA uses the approved gradient button (sky→indigo→cyan) with soft elevation.

- Emotional, engaging messaging
  - Hero title: "Write in a way that feels kind, clear & connected" with gradient text effect
  - Use warm, empathetic language that emphasizes psychological safety
  - Focus on benefits: "Fewer misunderstandings", "Softer tone, same honesty", "Better relationships at work"
  - Make the value proposition clear and human-centered

- Feature presentation
  - Use 3-column grid layout for feature cards on desktop
  - Each card: White/80 background with backdrop-blur, rounded corners, subtle shadow
  - Feature titles: "Rewrite with confidence", "Defuse tension, keep truth", "Grow your communication style"
  - Each card has colored accent text at bottom (emerald, amber, sky)
  - Keep large, readable type (title ≥ 20px, desc ≥ 14px)

- Video embedding
  - Use `react-lite-youtube-embed` and the env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_VIDEO_ID`; otherwise show the placeholder image.

- Use Mantine wrappers from our UI layer
  - Import only from `@/components/ui` wrappers (Button, Container, Text, Title, Image, etc.).

- Footer
  - Keep it subtle with Copyright, Help (`/app/help`), Terms (`/terms`), Privacy (`/privacy`).

## Don'ts

- Don't introduce a heavy navbar - simple header with logo and CTA is sufficient
- Don't use fake testimonials - use real beta user feedback if available
- Don't use Mantine primitives directly; never import from `@mantine/core` in (public)
- Don't add new libraries for scrolling without approval
- Don't use BackgroundMesh component - replaced with gradient background
- Don't use overly technical language - keep messaging warm and human-centered

## Approved/Optional Libraries

 - Approved
  - `gsap` for micro-interactions and small transitions
  - `react-lite-youtube-embed` for the demo video
  - `gsap` with `ScrollTrigger` for the feature scroller (pinned horizontal scrub + snap)

 - Optional (ask before adding)
  - None at this time

## Implementation Notes (current state)

- Background
  - Gradient background: `bg-gradient-to-b from-rose-50 via-amber-50 to-sky-50`
  - Creates warm, inviting atmosphere without heavy visual elements
  - No BackgroundMesh component needed - gradient provides visual interest

- Header
  - Simple header with Clarity logo (✨ icon + text) and "Add to Slack" button
  - Clean, minimal design that doesn't distract from main content

- Hero Section
  - Two-column layout: text content on left, visual element/testimonial on right
  - Title: Large, bold with gradient text effect on key phrase ("kind, clear & connected")
  - Subtitle: Warm, empathetic messaging about Clarity's value
  - Benefit badges: Three colored dots with short benefit statements
  - CTA button: Uses existing CTAButton component with Slack OAuth

- Feature Cards
  - 3-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile
  - Each card: White/80 background, backdrop-blur, rounded-xl, subtle shadow
  - Colored accent text at bottom (emerald, amber, sky) for visual hierarchy
  - Clean, readable typography with clear value propositions

- Live Example Section
  - Two-column layout: dark theme card (slate-900) showing original message
  - Light theme card showing improved version with explanations
  - Side panel: "Why this matters" with warm, human explanation
  - Uses actual message example to demonstrate value

- Typography
  - Hero title: `text-4xl md:text-5xl` with gradient text effect
  - Section titles: `text-3xl` or `text-2xl` for hierarchy
  - Body text: `text-lg` or `text-sm` depending on context
  - Use responsive sizing with Tailwind classes

- Button
  - Primary CTA: Use `CTAButton` component with gradient (sky→indigo→cyan)
  - Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl` (16px) for modern, friendly feel
  - Springy hover lift effect for interactivity
  - Header button: Can use standard Button component with rounded-2xl styling
  - Keep button styles consistent across the page

- Pricing & CTA section (updated)
  - Combined CTA + Pricing as one full-screen section: center-aligned content using `min-h-[100svh]` and flex column.
  - Post-features CTA text appears above pricing: “Ready to ship messages with clarity?” and supporting copy.
  - Pricing uses two cards (Free, Pro). Import only from `@/components/ui` wrappers.
  - Cards equal height: compute tallest card with `useLayoutEffect` and set both `minHeight` accordingly. Recalculate on window resize.
  - Card layout: use outer Card with `p={0}` and an inner padded wrapper for consistent border spacing.
  - Pro badge: full-width pill at the bottom of the Pro card, non-interactive, subtle translucent gradient with white border. No absolute positioning.
  - Footer: outside the pricing section and stuck to the bottom of page (`mt-auto`) so cards can expand freely.
  - Text sizing: increase contrast; small labels `/ forever` and `/ month` shown at ~14px; feature bullets at base size.
  - Spacing: keep description-to-bullets gap tight; larger overall inner padding is controlled on the inner wrapper.

## When to escalate

- If scrolling performance regresses, profile image sizes and `ScrollTrigger` bounds first.
- Avoid adding additional scrolling libraries; keep payload minimal.
