For example:\n- Re-check vitals if the first set is out of range, patient reports new/worsening symptoms, med changes were made today, or the visit runs >20\u201330 min.\n- Otherwise keep the initial set only.\n\nThis seems to help catch the cases where it matters (e.g., BP high on arrival or patient feels dizzy) without bottlenecking routine stable follow-ups.

I understand why you need it for donors and accountability (and I\u2019m not refusing), but on ground it is becoming hard especially when it\u2019s urgent like pipe joint leaking at night or a tap broken and women are queueing. My fundi and the water committee guys are telling me it slows them down because first we stop, take phone, open location, then pictures, then explain again why we are taking photos, and network is low so uploads fail and they feel we are doing \u201cinspection\u201d. Today the mwenyekiti at Kyandue committee told me straight that constant photos makes them feel we don\u2019t trust them, like serikali audit, and he asked if we think they are lying. I tried to calm it and explain it\u2019s for reporting to partners, si kwa kuwashuku, but you know trust is very sensitive and we have been building relationship slowly since last drought. Also sometimes household members don\u2019t want their faces or homestead in photo, so my team is now taking far pictures and it doesn\u2019t show the repair well, then we get question later.\n\nMaybe we can adjust how strict this is? For the small things (rubber washer, tightening clamp, replacing tap head) can we just log in the repair book + one photo per site per week, and only GPS/photo for bigger work or when it\u2019s new installation? If we keep pushing every time, committees will start refusing or delaying permission and then we look bad also. I\u2019m feeling squeezed between community and donor side honestly. Let me know what you think, I will be in field again tomorrow and want to avoid more complaint \ud83d\ude4f",
