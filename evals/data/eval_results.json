I wanted to share a quick concern from room flow.\n\nOn days when we are short-staffed, doing a full re-check for every follow-up tends to slow turnover (we can end up with patients waiting for rooms even when providers are ready).\n\nWould you be open to a narrower trigger instead? For example:\n- Re-check vitals if the first set is out of range, patient reports new/worsening symptoms, med changes were made today, or the visit runs >20\u201330 min.\n- Otherwise keep the initial set only.\n\nThis seems to help catch the cases where it matters (e.g., BP high on arrival or patient feels dizzy) without bottlenecking routine stable follow-ups. If you agree, I can align with the MAs on shift and we can trial it for a week and review.",

I understand why donors need GPS + photos for accountability, and we\u2019re not refusing that. However, on the ground this requirement is slowing response to urgent repairs and is harming trust with committees and households.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening:\n- Urgent fixes (leaking pipe at night, broken taps with people queueing) are delayed because teams stop to open location, take photos, and wait for uploads. Network is often poor.\n- Committees feel inspected and mistrusted. The mwenyekiti at Kyandue said the photo routine feels like a government audit and questioned whether we think they\u2019re lying.\n- Households sometimes refuse visible photos of faces/homesteads, so teams take distant shots that don\u2019t document the repair well.\n\nProposal:\n- For small repairs (rubber washer, clamp tightening, replacing tap head), log the work in the repair book and take one photo per site per week.\n- Reserve GPS + full photo documentation for new installations or major repairs.\n\nWhy: If we insist on full documentation every time, committees may refuse or delay permission and that will hurt both service delivery and our reputation.\n\nPlease let me know if you can approve this adjustment or suggest an alternative approach.
